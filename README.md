## Architecture

- **Framework**: Flutter (Dart)
- **State Management**: Stateful widgets with minimal reliance on external state management for simplicity.
- **Design Pattern**: Follows a modular structure inspired by MVVM principles:
  - **Models**: `User` model for handling user data.
  - **Views**: Widgets and screens for UI components.
  - **ViewModels/Services**: `AuthService` for authentication and secure storage operations.
- **Routing**: Custom `RouteGenerator` for dynamic route generation with slide transitions.
- **Data Storage**:
  - **Firebase Authentication**: For Google Sign-In.
  - **Flutter Secure Storage**: Stores user data locally for offline access.
- **Dependencies**:
  - `firebase_core`, `firebase_auth`: Firebase integration.
  - `google_sign_in`: Google Sign-In functionality.
  - `flutter_secure_storage`: Secure local storage.
  - `google_fonts`: For Poppins font.
  - `confetti`: For gamified animations.
  - `share_plus`: For app sharing.
  - `google_nav_bar`: For bottom navigation.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**:

   - Flutter SDK (version 3.16 or later)
   - Dart (version 3.2 or later)
   - Firebase project with Authentication enabled
   - Android/iOS emulator or physical device

2. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd wellbeing
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Configure Firebase**:

   - Create a Firebase project at Firebase Console.
   - Enable Google Sign-In in the Authentication section.
   - Download `google-services.json` (Android) or `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) and place them in the respective platform directories.
   - Update `android/build.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle` with Firebase dependencies as per the Firebase setup guide.

5. **Add Assets**:

   - Place the background image (`bg10.jpg`) and Google logo (`google.png`) in `lib/assets/images/`.

   - Update `pubspec.yaml` to include assets:

     ```yaml
     assets:
       - lib/assets/images/bg10.jpg
       - lib/assets/images/google.png
     ```

6. **Run the App**:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Assumptions and Notes

- **Mock Data**: Reward points, daily streak, leaderboard, and subscription status use static mock data due to the absence of a backend.
- **Placeholder Screens**:
  - Alerts tab is a placeholder with minimal UI.
  - Mood Meter and EQ Lessons are implemented as tappable cards with snackbar feedback.
- **Simulated Features**:
  - Payment flows (Razorpay, UPI) are simulated with a 2-second delay and success feedback.
  - Coaching audio tasks are represented as tappable cards without actual audio integration.
- **Firebase Integration**: Assumes a Firebase project is set up with Google Sign-In enabled. No Firestore or Realtime Database is used; user data is stored locally.
- **Gamification**: Confetti animations and progress bars enhance the habit-forming experience, with locked stages to encourage sequential completion.
- **UI Design**: Emphasizes a modern, vibrant aesthetic with gradients, shadows, and glassmorphism for an engaging user experience.

## Code Quality

- **Clean Code**: Modularized widgets and services with clear naming conventions.
- **Comments**: Key functions and widgets include inline comments for clarity.
- **Error Handling**: Authentication and storage operations include try-catch blocks with user feedback via snackbars.
- **Scalability**: The app structure supports future additions like backend integration or additional tabs.

## Creativity and Product Thinking

- **Habit-Forming Design**: Gamified elements (confetti, progress bars, locked stages) motivate users to maintain daily engagement.
- **User-First Approach**: Intuitive onboarding, responsive UI, and haptic feedback prioritize user experience.
- **Emotional Well-being Focus**: Dedicated section for mood tracking and EQ lessons aligns with the appâ€™s goal of fostering discipline and positivity.

## Known Limitations

- **Backend Absence**: No real-time data storage or user progress syncing due to reliance on local storage.
- **Placeholder Features**: Alerts tab, Mood Meter, and EQ Lessons are not fully functional.
- **Mock Payments**: Payment flows are simulated without actual payment gateway integration.
- **Single Platform**: Currently optimized for Android; iOS testing is pending.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate Firestore for real-time user data and progress tracking.
- Implement actual audio playback for coaching tasks.
- Expand the Alerts tab with notifications and reminders.
- Add backend support for leaderboard and subscription management.
- Enhance Mood Meter and EQ Lessons with interactive UI and video content.
